Many persons contributed actively to the creation and improvement of myCAT. Among them Olanto would like to thank some of the developers for their outstanding contribution.

  -  Nizar Ghoula for developing most of the GUIs of myCAT with GWT

  -  Jacques Guyot for developing most of the DB and TBX converter


We would like also to thank the Free IT Foundation in Geneva, Switzerland (http://free-it-foundation.org/) for helping so much in bringing Olanto to light and in organizing the distribution of its software.

To all of you, a warm thank you for your professional attitude and your kindness.

The Olanto Team.
