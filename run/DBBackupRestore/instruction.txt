To export/ dump a database just do the following steps

Give the absolute path for both mysql bin server and the path where the sql file is to be dumped

@echo off 
cd "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin"
mysqldump --host=localhost --user=root --password --result-file="C:\MYTERM\mysql\dump\myTermDBDump071315.sql" myterm
echo Done!
pause
exit
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
To import a file to a database you dont have to give absolute url, just place the sql file in the same folder as your batch file

@echo off
cd "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin"
mysql --host=localhost --user=root --password -myterm -e "source C:\MYTERM\mysql\dump\myTermDBDump071315.sql;"
echo Done!
pause
exit
